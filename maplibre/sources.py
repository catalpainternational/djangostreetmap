Sources state which data the map should display.
Specify the type of source with the "type" property,
which must be one of vector, raster, raster-dem, geojson,
image, video. Adding a source isn't enough to make data
appear on the map because sources don't contain styling
details like color or width. Layers refer to a source
and give it a visual representation. This makes it possible
to style the same source in different ways,
like differentiating between types of roads in
a highways layer.
